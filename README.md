# Package Challenge 

## Problem Description



You want to send your friend a package with different items. You can choose from a number of `N` items. The items are numbered from 1 to `N`. Each one of these items has a given weight and a given cost (in â‚¬), where the weights and costs of the items might be different. The package itself has a weight limit. The combined weight of the items you put in the package must not exceed the weight limit of the package, otherwise the package would be too heavy.

Your goal is to determine which items to put in the package so that the total cost of the items you put inside is as large as possible. In case the total cost the of the packaged items is the same for two sets of items, you should prefer the combination of items which has a lower total weight.
